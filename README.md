Square Detection and its overlapping

In the project an image named CVtask is there which contains boxes of different shapes and of different colours. Also there is four aruco markers of different unspecified ids.The images HA.jpg, HaHa.jpg, XD.jpg and LMAO.jpg are the four aruco markers. The task is to detect the square boxes from the given image named CVtask and  to overlap aruco markers with those boxes with proper orientation. It had constraints that the particular colour square box should be overlapped with a particular id aruco marker.I need to overlap the aruco markers with the square boxes with proper orientation and ids . The output.png file which is uploaded contains the output image of the overlapped image of the aruco markers with the square boxes. The file name a.py contains the code for the given task .
